## What is the use of the .bashrc file?

Bash is a shell, a command processor that typically runs in a text window where the user types commands that cause actions.

The .bashrc file is a configuration file that is executed whenever a new terminal session is started in **interactive mode**. This file contains commands to set up the shell for use in your particular environment. 

You can use it to save time and typing by:
- setting environment variables (e.g. editing the prompt and PATH)
- sourcing helper files (e.g. making spack commands work without eval())
- defining aliases - give a shortened name to a command you enter frequently
- defining functions - name a sequence of commands that you will reuse and that may take input. (NOTE: This is specific to your user profile. Others won't be able to use or see code here.)

On HTCF, .bashrc is sourced by your login shell and the shells you enter after running srun or salloc commands. 

This file will not be sourced for batch jobs submitted to SLURM using ```sbatch yourjobscript.sh```. 

## suggested .bashrc additions
1. Copy what you find useful from the code block below
2. open a terminal and connect to HTCF using ssh (review [these instructions](https://github.com/dbaldridge-lab/htcf/blob/main/htcf_access.md))
3. open the .bashrc file by typing ```nano ~/.bashrc``` and pressing `enter`
4. press the down arrow key until your cursor is at the end of the file
5. Press `cmd+v` to add the text to the bottom of your file
6. Press `ctrl+x` to exit, type `y` to save.
7. To see changes reflected, type ```source ~/.bashrc``` at the prompt and press `enter`
