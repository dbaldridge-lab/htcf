## Installing new software
Start an interactive session prior to beginning installation. 
If the install is expected to take a significant amount of time, consider submitting a bash script using sbatch. 

First, confirm that the software has not already been installed:
1. Check the lab software folder
   ```
   cd /ref/dblab/software
   ```
3. Check the spack lab instance:
   ```
   spack find -x
   ```

Next, consult the software's documentation. 
1. Ensure dependancies are met.
2. Look for suggested installation steps.

Not all software can be installed using spack. To see if the software exists as a spack package:
```
spack list yourKeyword
```
Available packages are also searchable [here.](https://packages.spack.io/)

Install the package to the lab spack instance:
```
spack install yourSpackPackage
```

The package can now be added to a spack environment.

## Adding spack packages to an existing environment
Display all spack environments that exist in the lab spack instance:
```
spack env list
```
Activate one of the pre-existing environments:
```
spack env activate -p yourEnvironment
```
View the spack packages that are already in the environment. 
The x flag is used to omit dependancies.
```
spack find -x
```
Add spack packages, seperating each with a space. 
Use @ to denote version:
```
spack add samtools python@3.10.4  # add spack packages
```
Exit the environment:
```
spack env deactivate
```
Reactivate the environment:
```
spack env activate -p yourEnvironment
```
Finalize the new updates:
```
spack concretize
```

## Adding modules to python in a spack environment
Activate one of the pre-existing environments:
```
spack env activate -p yourEnvironment
```
Check if pip is installed.
```
python3 -m pip --version
```
If pip is not working, try to install it. 
```Â 
python3 -m ensurepip
```
If that doesn't work, upgrade pip to the latest version.
```
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
```
Load new python modules using the pip installer:
```
python3 -m pip install yourModule yourModule2
```
To confirm that a module was loaded:
1. Invoke the python interpreter
   ```
   python3
   ```
2. Run a test command
   ```
   yourModule
   ```
3. Exit python interactive mode
   ```
   exit
   ```

Adding spack packages to an environment will wipe out existing python modules.
Prior to adding new spack packages, back up your pip environment:
```
python3 -m pip freeze > my-reqs.txt
```
Reinstall after concretization:
```
python3 -m pip install -r my-reqs.txt
```

## Creating a new environment

Create a new environment if there is a specific set of software and dependancies that you want to isolate and be able to reload in future sessions. This example will create an enviornment with everything needed to run Jupyter notebooks on the server. 
```
spack env create jupyter
```
Activate the new environment:
```
spack env activate -p jupyter
```
Add spack packages, seperating each with a space. Use @ to denote version of a spack spec:
```
This assumes we've already installed the spack packages for this version of python and Jupyter lab to the spack instance. 
spack add python@3.11.0 py-jupyterlab py-nbconvert  # add spack packages
```

## Troubleshooting
### Can't add a spack package
Make sure you already installed the packages to the spack instance. Check this using `spack find -x`.

### Namespace issues
Occasionally, you may run into namespace issues if another user installed the spec to the lab spack instance. You can install another copy to the same spack instance and reference the spec you installed in this case. Reference specific specs using `#`.
